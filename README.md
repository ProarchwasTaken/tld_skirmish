**True Human Tribulation: Skirmish** is a wave-based fighter where you
have to survive against multiple waves of enemies. The game features 
controls simple enough that you could play with just an SNES controller.

## Gamepad
The controls detailed here are based on the SNES button layout, so it
maybe different on other layouts. So try experimenting and see what the
buttons do.

WARNING: Depending on what controller you're using, pressing down all 4
D-Pad button may crash the game. Since problem comes from the GLFW

# Synopsis
**True Human Tribulation: Skirmish** is a wave-based fighter where you
have to survive against multiple waves of enemies. The game features 
controls simple enough that you could play with just an SNES controller.


# Discord
This game marks as the second entry in an Urban Fantasy anthology series 
about an average human rising up to face the supernatural. If you wish
to keep track of the game's development, or comsume media that relates to
the core idea and themes of the series, I suggest that you check out the
discord server.

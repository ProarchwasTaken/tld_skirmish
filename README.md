# Synopsis
**True Human Tribulation: Skirmish** is a wave-based fighter where you
have to survive against multiple waves of enemies. The game features 
controls simple enough that you could play with just an SNES controller.


# Discord
This game marks as the second entry in an Urban Fantasy anthology series 
about an average human rising up to face the supernatural. If you wish
to keep track of the game's development, or comsume media that relates to
the core idea and themes of the series, I suggest that you check out the
discord server.

The controls detailed here are based on the SNES button layout, so it
maybe different on other layouts. So try experimenting and see what the
buttons do.

WARNING: Depending on what controller you're using, pressing down all 4

# Personal Thoughts
This project began development on the 30th on April, and finished on
Christmas day of 2024. That totals to around 7 months, and 26 days of 
development time. Which is ironically almost the same amount of time I've
spent working on Errand Run before I gave up.

It's pretty funny how I spent so much time on a game that only has like
10 minutes of content, but I guess that's how game development is
sometimes. I've long since learned that's it's a very time consuming 
process. Sometimes, I wonder if I could have got it done faster if I had
just used a game engine like Unity, Unreal, or Godot. Probably not since
those engine have learning curves of their own, and given I would have 
less control on how the engine functions, I probably wouldn't ran into
even more issues.

That's besides the point, I finally finished a game for one! Sure, it's 
only 10 minute long and has a lot of flaws, but it's still a game
nonetheless. I overcame development hell, now have something to show for 
it!

Now I have a lot more free time to focus on other things, and go back to
making small projects to learn stuff. Eventually, when the time is right,
I'll begin work on the third game of the series. Since I've already put
in the time to make the engine, I'll probably reuse it for future games,
since it would be a waste otherwise.

If you're reading this, and are taking time out of your day just to play
this 10 minute game; I would like to thank you. I really appreciate it.

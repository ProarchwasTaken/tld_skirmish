This directory contains templates for the majority of the game's art like
the stages. To be honest, when creating custom art for stages, pretty much
anything goes at the end of the day. These templates are meant to act as
guidelines for how to should draw a stages. Since y'know, that's how all
templates are meant to be used.

With these templates you could most likely do better than me, so go wild!
The template is primarily made using gimp and ported to other file 
formats. One of which being openraster, which I think is the format most
drawing programs use. The other being for paint.net.
